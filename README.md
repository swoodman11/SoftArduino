# SoftArduino
Laser cutting and design files for the stretchable circuits presented in Soft Arduinos (Citation and DOI HERE once published).
Feel free to use these directly, or just use them to get a sense of the process I used (Drawing files --> DXF --> ULS laser --> LPKF laser) to create designs. 

Feel free to submit other designs to this repo as you make them!

Recently added is a BOM (tools and materials) and SOP. I have also uploaded a manufacturing video to YouTube at this link: [ADD LINK once published]
