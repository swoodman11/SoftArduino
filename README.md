# Stretchable Arduinos
Hi everyone! We want to facilitate the fabrication of stretchable electronics by the public. This page has laser cutting (LPKF Laser) and design files in CorelDRAW for the stretchable circuits presented in "Stretchable Arduinos embedded in soft robots" (Vol. 9 Issue 94, Sept. 2024), doi: 10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844). This work comes out of [The Faboratory at Yale University](https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/), and was funded largely by NASA! 

With just the designs from the paper, you can make stretchable Arduino Pro Minis, Sparkfun Sound Detectors, and Sparkfun RGB and Gesture Sensors. Check out the paper and supplementary materials for more direction, and the procedure and BOM here for more manufacturing info. Feel free to use these directly, or just use them to get a sense of the process we used (Drawing files --> DXF --> ULS laser --> LPKF laser) to create designs. Pick any open source or custom design that you like, and feel free to submit other designs to this repo as you make them! 

Let's get fabricating!! 

We recently added a list of recommended tools and materials ("BOM_tools_and_materials") and a manufacturing procedure ("Soft Circuit Procedure 3.26.2024"). Additionally, you can find an instructional manufacturing [on YouTube](https://youtu.be/nDWBUMG_oVs).

Reach out to me at stephanie.woodman@yale.edu with any questions! :)

Best,
Steph and the stretch Arduino author team
