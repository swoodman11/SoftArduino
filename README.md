# Stretchable Arduinos
Laser cutting and design files for the stretchable circuits presented in Stretchable Arduinos embedded (Vol. 9 Issue 94, Sept. 2024), doi: 10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844).
Feel free to use these directly, or just use them to get a sense of the process I used (Drawing files --> DXF --> ULS laser --> LPKF laser) to create designs. 

Feel free to submit other designs to this repo as you make them!

Recently added is a BOM (tools and materials) and SOP. I have also uploaded a manufacturing video to YouTube at this link: https://youtu.be/nDWBUMG_oVs
