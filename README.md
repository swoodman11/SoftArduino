# Stretchable Arduinos
Hi everyone! This page wants to facilitate the fabrication of stretchable electronics by the public. This page has laser cutting (LPKF Laser) and design files in CorelDRAW for the stretchable circuits presented in "Stretchable Arduinos embedded in soft robots" (Vol. 9 Issue 94, Sept. 2024), doi: 10.1126/scirobotics.adn6844). This work comes out of The Faboratory (https://www.eng.yale.edu/faboratory/) at Yale Univresity, and was funded largely by NASA! 

With just the designs from the paper, you can make stretchable Arduino Pro Minis, Sparkfun Sound Detectors, and Sparkfun RGB and Gestrure Sensors. Check out the paper and supplementary materials for more direction, and the procedure and BOM here for more manufacturing info. Feel free to use these directly, or just use them to get a sense of the process I used (Drawing files --> DXF --> ULS laser --> LPKF laser) to create designs. Pick any open source or custom design that you like, and feel free to submit other designs to this repo as you make them! 

Let's get fabricating!! 

Recently added is a BOM (tools and materials) and SOP. I have also uploaded a manufacturing video to YouTube at this link: https://youtu.be/nDWBUMG_oVs
